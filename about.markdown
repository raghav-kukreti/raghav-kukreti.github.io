Hi, my name's Raghav Kukreti, I'm a final-year CSE undergrad at IIIT Delhi.

Currently, I am interning at [Juspay](https://juspay.in/), a payments company in Bangalore. My work there includes working on Data (R, Julia, Python), the Web (Purescript, RShiny) and Design (Sketch).

My interests are also aligned with my work, I'm currently researching generative music; a part of which I implemented at [HackInOut 2019](https://hackinout.co/), called [Rosaline](https://github.com/raghav-kukreti/rosaline). Parallel to this, I (used to) run a consultancy called [DeepFlowData](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepflowdata/), which built data-centric solutions for pharmacovigilance applications.

Apart from this, I also experiment with making music and graphics. I upload semi-frequently on my SoundCloud under the moniker [KUK&#8377;ETI](https://soundcloud.com/raghav-kukreti). All of my work, and media which I use frequently are listed in the side pane.
