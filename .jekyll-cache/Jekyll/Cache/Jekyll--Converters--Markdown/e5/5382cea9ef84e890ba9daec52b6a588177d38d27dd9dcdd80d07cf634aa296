I"¨<p>Hi, my nameâ€™s Raghav Kukreti, Iâ€™m a final-year CSE undergrad at IIIT Delhi.</p>

<p>Currently, I am interning at <a href="https://juspay.in/">Juspay</a>, a payments company in Bangalore. My work there includes working on Data (R, Julia, Python), the Web (Purescript, RShiny) and Design (Sketch).</p>

<p>My interests are also aligned with my work, Iâ€™m currently researching generative music; a part of which I implemented at <a href="https://hackinout.co/">HackInOut 2019</a>, called <a href="https://github.com/raghav-kukreti/rosaline">Rosaline</a>. Parallel to this, I (used to) run a consultancy called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepflowdata/">DeepFlowData</a>, which built data-centric solutions for pharmacovigilance applications.</p>

<p>Apart from this, I also experiment with making music and graphics. I upload semi-frequently on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/raghav-kukreti">SoundCloud</a>.</p>
