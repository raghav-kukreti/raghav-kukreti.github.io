					Flat Design, flat colors, long shadows are terms extensively used in the modern web. So, what do these mean? Why are they so popular? How did they come into existence?
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Flat design is simply elements without extensive gradients, drop shadows or flashy hover/focus states. 
					An even simpler definition is element which are 2D instead of 3D. Gradients were an extremely popular style option until couple of months before until iOS 7 showed the world how flat icons could easily replace their older counterparts. An example is shown below <br><br>
					<a href="#" class="gradb">Gradient Button</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#" class="flatb">Flat Button</a>
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					As you can see, flat buttons are much more simpler to make and looks much more professional as compared to the gradient button.
